# Project Brief: LaundryShare

---

## Executive Summary

**LaundryShare** is a peer-to-peer laundry service platform that connects people who own washing machines with those who need laundry services. Think "Uber for laundry" - but as a full-service offering where hosts handle the complete washing, drying, and optional add-ons.

**Primary Problem:** Students, renters, and urban dwellers without washing machines rely on expensive, inconvenient laundromats that require travel, waiting, and multiple trips.

**Target Market:** Students and young professionals in dense urban areas, particularly university cities.

**Key Value Proposition:** 30% cheaper than laundromats, more convenient (neighborhood-based), full-service (drop-off and pick-up), plus an income opportunity for machine owners.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State & Pain Points

People without washing machines - particularly students, young renters, and urban apartment dwellers - face significant friction when doing laundry:

- **Distance:** Laundromats are often far from home, requiring travel
- **Time waste:** Must wait at the laundromat or make multiple trips (drop off, pick up)
- **Cost:** Laundromat prices are high and increasing
- **Inconvenience:** Fixed hours, crowded peak times, no reservations
- **Unpleasant experience:** Public spaces, sometimes poorly maintained

### Impact of the Problem

- Students spend 2-4 hours per week on laundry logistics
- Average urban laundromat cost: €5-10 per load (wash + dry)
- Laundry is consistently ranked as a top pain point for students and renters

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

| Solution | Limitation |
|----------|------------|
| Laundromats | Expensive, inconvenient, time-consuming |
| Laundry delivery apps (Cleanly, etc.) | Premium pricing, corporate feel, not community-based |
| Friends/neighbors (informal) | Awkward to ask, no payment structure, unreliable |

### Urgency

The sharing economy has transformed transportation (Uber), accommodation (Airbnb), and food delivery - yet laundry remains stuck in the traditional model. Urban density and rising living costs make this problem increasingly acute, especially for cost-conscious students.

---

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept

LaundryShare is a mobile application that creates a two-sided marketplace connecting:
- **Users:** People who need laundry done
- **Hosts:** People with washing machines who want to earn extra income

Unlike simple machine-sharing, LaundryShare is a **full-service model**: users drop off their laundry, hosts handle everything (washing, drying, folding), and users pick up clean clothes.

### How It Works

1. **User** searches for nearby hosts and books a time slot
2. **User** drops off laundry at host's home
3. **Host** washes, dries, and prepares the laundry
4. **User** receives notification when ready and picks up
5. **Payment** is handled automatically through the platform

### Key Differentiators

| vs. Laundromats | vs. Laundry Apps (Cleanly, etc.) |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| 30% cheaper | Peer-to-peer = lower overhead costs |
| Closer (neighborhood-based) | Community feel, not corporate |
| Full service (no waiting) | Hosts earn income (two-sided value) |
| Book in advance | More accessible price point |

### Why This Solution Will Succeed

1. **Proven model:** Uber and Airbnb validated that people will share assets/services with strangers when trust mechanisms exist
2. **Dual incentive:** Both sides benefit - users save money/time, hosts earn income
3. **Underserved market:** No dominant peer-to-peer laundry platform exists
4. **Low barrier:** Hosts already own machines; no new investment required

### High-Level Vision

Start as a laundry marketplace, expand to become the go-to platform for neighborhood-based home services - ironing, folding, mending, and beyond.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

**User App:**

| Feature | Description & Rationale |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Search nearby hosts** | Map/list view showing available hosts by proximity - core discovery mechanism |
| **View host profiles** | Basic info, ratings, services offered, availability - builds trust |
| **Instant booking** | Select time slot and book immediately - reduces friction |
| **In-app payment** | Secure payment via platform - enables commission model, builds trust |
| **Order tracking** | Status updates: booked → dropped off → washing → ready → picked up |
| **Push notifications** | "Your laundry is ready!" - critical for drop-off/pick-up model |
| **In-app chat** | Communication between user and host - coordination without sharing phone numbers |
| **Rating & review** | Rate hosts after service - quality control mechanism |

**Host App:**

| Feature | Description & Rationale |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Set availability** | Define when host can accept bookings - prevents overbooking |
| **Manage bookings** | View upcoming, active, and past orders |
| **Update order status** | Mark as received, washing, ready - triggers user notifications |
| **In-app chat** | Communicate with users |
| **View earnings** | Track completed orders and income |
| **Withdraw earnings** | Transfer money to bank account |
| **Offer add-on services** | Define optional services (ironing, folding, delivery) with flat fees |

**Platform/Backend:**

| Feature | Description & Rationale |
|---------|------------------------|
| **User registration/auth** | Email/phone signup, basic verification |
| **Host onboarding** | Simple flow to register as host |
| **Payment processing** | Integration with payment provider (Stripe, etc.) |
| **Commission handling** | Automatic platform fee deduction |
| **Basic admin dashboard** | Monitor transactions, users, hosts |

### Out of Scope for MVP

| Feature | Reason for Exclusion |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Pickup & delivery service** | Adds logistics complexity - test core model first |
| **Subscription plans** | Need usage data before designing subscriptions |
| **Advanced host verification** | Start with basic ID, iterate based on trust issues |
| **Multi-language support** | Launch in one market first |
| **Loyalty/rewards program** | Focus on core value prop, add later |
| **Host insurance program** | Research Airbnb model first, implement in v2 |
| **Automated pricing** | Platform sets fixed prices initially |
| **Social features** | No friend referrals, social sharing in MVP |

### MVP Success Criteria

The MVP is successful if:

1. **Users complete bookings** - End-to-end flow works (search → book → pay → drop off → pick up)
2. **Hosts earn money** - Payment processing and withdrawal function correctly
3. **Retention signal** - At least 50% of users who complete first booking return for a second
4. **Host satisfaction** - Hosts remain active (not churning after 1-2 orders)
5. **Quality baseline** - Average rating ≥ 4.0 (indicates acceptable service quality)
6. **No critical trust failures** - No significant theft, damage, or safety incidents

---

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features (Post-Validation)

Once MVP is validated and initial traction achieved:

| Feature | Priority | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Pickup & delivery service** | High | Hosts can offer to collect/return laundry - major convenience upgrade |
| **Host insurance/guarantee** | High | Airbnb-style protection - builds trust, reduces friction |
| **Advanced ID verification** | High | Photo ID, selfie match - increases safety perception |
| **Recurring bookings** | Medium | "Every Tuesday" scheduling - improves retention, predictable income for hosts |
| **Host competition/pricing** | Medium | Allow hosts to set own prices once supply is strong |
| **Referral program** | Medium | User invites friend, both get credit - growth lever |
| **Multi-language support** | Medium | Expand to new markets |
| **Subscription plans** | Low | Monthly plans for frequent users - once usage patterns clear |

### Long-Term Vision (1-2 Years)

**From laundry platform to neighborhood services marketplace.**

LaundryShare establishes trust between neighbors through a low-stakes, routine service (laundry). This trust foundation enables expansion into adjacent services.

**Year 1 Focus:**
- Dominant laundry platform in 3-5 major cities
- Strong brand recognition among students and young professionals
- Profitable unit economics, sustainable growth

**Year 2 Expansion:**
- Geographic expansion to 10+ cities
- Service expansion beyond laundry
- Potential B2B partnerships (student housing, corporate housing)

### Expansion Opportunities

| Opportunity | Description | Strategic Fit |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Ironing & alterations** | Hosts offer garment care beyond washing | Natural extension, same hosts |
| **Dry cleaning pickup** | Partner with dry cleaners, hosts as drop points | Leverages host network |
| **Home services marketplace** | Pet sitting, plant watering, package receiving | Trust already established |
| **Student housing partnerships** | Exclusive provider for dorms/residences | B2B revenue, captive users |
| **Corporate relocations** | Laundry service for temporary housing | Higher-value segment |
| **White-label platform** | License tech to property managers | SaaS revenue stream |

**Geographic Expansion Model:**
1. Prove model in City 1 (likely Paris or major university city)
2. Replicate playbook in City 2-3
3. Raise funding for accelerated expansion
4. City-by-city rollout following university calendar (September launches)

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

| Type | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Budget** | Unknown | To be defined - affects team size, marketing spend, third-party services |
| **Timeline** | Unknown | No hard deadline mentioned - recommend defining target launch window |
| **Resources** | Unknown | Team composition unclear - solo founder? Co-founders? Hiring plan? |
| **Technical** | None identified | No legacy systems, starting fresh |
| **Geographic** | Urban focus | Dense cities only (rural areas won't have sufficient density) |
| **Regulatory** | Unknown | Legal research needed for home-based laundry services |

### Key Assumptions

**Market Assumptions:**
- Students and renters actively seek cheaper laundry alternatives
- Current laundromat experience is painful enough to drive behavior change
- Urban density provides sufficient host/user proximity
- 30% price reduction is achievable while maintaining host profitability

**User Behavior Assumptions:**
- Users are comfortable dropping clothes at a stranger's home (with trust mechanisms)
- Users will wait for notification and return for pickup
- Price and convenience outweigh "awkwardness" of peer-to-peer model

**Host Behavior Assumptions:**
- People will open their homes to strangers for extra income
- Hosts can deliver consistent quality service
- Easy money motivates hosts to remain active
- Hosts are willing to handle strangers' laundry (not everyone will be)

**Business Model Assumptions:**
- Commission-based model is sustainable at scale
- Platform-controlled pricing works initially (hosts accept it)
- Per-kg pricing is practical and fair
- Users and hosts will transact through the platform (not go "off-platform")

**Competitive Assumptions:**
- No dominant P2P laundry platform exists in target market
- Laundromats won't/can't respond quickly to competition
- Laundry delivery apps target higher price segment (not direct competitors)

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

| Risk | Severity | Impact | Mitigation Ideas |
|------|----------|--------|------------------|
| **Chicken & egg problem** | High | Can't attract users without hosts, can't attract hosts without users | Recruit hosts first, offer incentives, focus on small geographic area |
| **Trust barrier** | High | Users won't leave clothes with strangers; hosts won't let strangers in | Airbnb-style verification, ratings, insurance/guarantee program |
| **Quality inconsistency** | High | Bad experiences kill reputation fast | Rating system, quality guidelines, remove low-rated hosts |
| **Liability issues** | High | Damaged/lost clothes, accidents in homes | Clear terms of service, insurance program, dispute resolution |
| **Off-platform transactions** | Medium | Users/hosts bypass platform after first meeting | Provide ongoing value (payment protection, dispute resolution, convenience) |
| **Host churn** | Medium | Hosts stop offering service after initial enthusiasm | Ensure hosts earn enough, provide support, gamification |
| **Regulatory challenges** | Medium | Home business permits, tax implications, labor laws | Legal research, consult lawyer, start in permissive jurisdiction |
| **Competitor entry** | Low | Established player copies model | Move fast, build brand loyalty, network effects |
| **Seasonal demand** | Low | Students leave during summer | Target multiple segments, diversify geography |

### Open Questions

**Business Model:**
- What commission percentage balances platform revenue vs. host earnings?
- What is the right price per kg to achieve 30% savings while paying hosts fairly?
- Should there be a minimum order size?

**Operations:**
- How long should a standard wash cycle booking last?
- What happens if a user is late to pick up?
- What if a host cancels last-minute?

**Trust & Safety:**
- What verification level is required for hosts? Users?
- How do we handle damage disputes?
- Do we need insurance from day 1 or can it wait?

**Growth:**
- Which city to launch first?
- What's the minimum host density per neighborhood?
- How to recruit initial hosts cost-effectively?

**Legal:**
- Do hosts need permits for home-based service?
- Tax implications for host earnings?
- Platform liability exposure?

## Appendices

### A. Research Summary

*Based on brainstorming session conducted during project brief creation:*

**Key Findings from Ideation:**

| Area | Finding |
|------|---------|
| **Market Gap** | No known peer-to-peer laundry platform in target market (France/Europe) |
| **Competitor Landscape** | Existing laundry apps are delivery-focused, premium-priced, corporate feel |
| **Unique Angle** | Two-sided value: users save money AND hosts can earn money |
| **Target Insight** | Students in urban/university areas are ideal first users (price-sensitive, no machines, concentrated) |
| **Go-to-Market** | Supply-first strategy: recruit hosts before marketing to users |
| **Trust Model** | Follow Airbnb approach: casual community feel with real protection underneath |

**Validated Decisions:**
- Full-service model (host does laundry, not just machine access)
